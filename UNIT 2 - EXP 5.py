#Simple Working.......

#For AGGTAB and GXTXAYB:
#Create a DP table to store LCS lengths.
#Compare characters of both sequences.
#If characters are same, add 1 to the diagonal value.
#If characters are different, take the maximum of the top and left values.
#The last cell gives the length of LCS.
#Trace the table backwards to find the actual LCS.
#The final answer is GTAB, with length 4.
